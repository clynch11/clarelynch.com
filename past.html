        <p class="about-me">During the pandemic I began making educational videos as part of my music teaching business.
        I started out making basic videos on iMovie but soon became curious to learn how more engaging animated videos were made. 
        I used Da Vinci Resolve to make the following lessons and performances.

            <h3 class="centered-text">Online Violin Courses</h3>
            <p class="about-me">As I made more videos, I began organising them into short courses in violin playing. 
                I hosted these courses using Teachable, desiging both the course content using tools such as Canva
                 and the sales pages. 
                The site can be viewd <a target="blank" class="link" href="https://steps2music.teachable.com/">here!</a>

                <p class="about-me">I also began an instagram page to promote the new part of my business and did extensive research into 
                social media marketing. 
                The instagram page can be viewed @steps2music.</p>

                <p class="about-me"> As I was increasingly enjoying the technical side of this project and
                looking towards a career change, this project became a hobby that I now work on when I have free time.</p>
