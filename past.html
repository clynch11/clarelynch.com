        <h3 class="centered-text">Python Object Oriented Programming Project - Rock Snake!</h3>
        <h5 class="centered-text">September 2022</h5>
        <p class="about-me">As part of my final assessment for Python, 
            I coded the snake game using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 
            This involved planning the game and working out the algorithm in detail before
            finally implementing the code. Drawio was used to create the diagrams for the 
            initial planning stage. </p>

            <h5 class="centered-text">Using Object Oriented Programming </h5>    
    
                <p class="about-me"> Object Oriented Programming (OOP) essentially creates a template (called a class)
                    to describe real world objects. In a simple example, a class "employee" may be created to hold
                    information about all employees at a particular company. All employees have some things in common 
                    (for example, the company they work for). These are called <b>class attributes</b> and apply to every 
                    record (called an instance) that we create later on. Each employee will also have attributes specific to themselves, such as their name
                    and employee number. These are called instance attributes. We may then wish to define functions (called methods)
                    to call later in our program. Check out my early study notes working through a simple OOP example 
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clynch11/Python-Beginner-Coding/blob/main/SimpleOOP.ipynb">here!</a>
                    In this example, calling the 'role' method will print '[employee] works in [area]' to the screen. 
                    In the snake game, I used classes Snake, Food, Sounds and Messages.

                <p class="about-me">The x and y variables are first used to draw the 'snake' to the screen. 
                    x_change moves the snake 20px in the direction specified by the user. Pygame KEYDOWN is used
                    to detect keyboard input. x += x_change means that the value of x_change (+ or - 20px) is added to or 
                    subtracted from the value of x (coordinates of the current position)
                    each time the main loop runs (5 times per second). The same is specified for the y axis, allowing the snake 
                    to move continously. </p>

                <h5 class="centered-text">Extra work</h5>

                <p class="about-me">Once I had solved some initial problems getting the snake to move using OOP, 
                    I had a lot of fun and decided to add a few extra features to make it look cool! &#128526 
                
                <h5 class="centered-text">Color Change</h5>

                <p class="about-me">The current snake length is divided in two to find the halfway point.
                    When this point reaches 50px from the border, the snake should turn red to show he is 
                    in danger!</p>
                
                <h5 class="centered-text">Snake Speed</h5>

                <p class="about-me">Pygame KEYDOWN is used to allow the user to increase or decrease the snake speed.
                This is done by increasing/decreasing the number of times the main loop runs per second
                each time the specified keys are pressed.</p>

    <h3 class="centered-text">Coding a simple chat app using Fernet encryption</h3>
    <h5 class="centered-text">September 2022</h5>
    <p class="about-me">One of my final Python projects involved creating a simple chat app, using 
        Fernet to encrypt messages as they travel accross the network. This involved creating a client
        and a server, binding the server to a socket to allow it to listen for incoming connections
        and then creating a simple WHILE loop to allow communication to continue until someone typed 'quit'. 
    </p>

    <input type="button" value="Click here to read more" class="red-button" onClick="document.getElementById('fernet').style.display='block';">
    </div>
            <div id="fernet" class="modal">
            <h3 class="centered-text">More about Fernet </h3>    
            <p class="about-me">Fernet is part of Python's cryptography library and provides symmetric encryption,
                meaning that the same cryptographic key is held at each end of the connection and used
                for both encryption and decryption. This key is supplied by the user and must be 256 bits in length.
                Fernet uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is an encryption algorithm developed 
                by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and used commonly, including for HTTPS.
                Fernet produces a token based on the plaintext message entered, a timestamp and the key. This token
                includes the encrypted version of the message as well as information to verify it's integrity. 
                The ciphertext will always be a multiple of the 128-bit block size. If the message entered is not 128 bits,
                fernet will use padding to fill up any space that has not been used.

            mySQL. The first project involoved designing a relational database while the second half of the subject
            focused on mySQL. MySQL Workbench and the command line on my Ubuntu virtual machine were used to create, edit and delete sample databases.

                        <p class="about-me">The relational database model was developed by E.F. Codd of
                            IBM in the 1970s. A relational database is a collection of tables
                            with columns (attributes - the template of our table) and rows (entries/records which will store the actual data). 
                            Each table must have a unique, identifying attribute which is called the primary key. 
                            A foreign key references the primary key of another table and in this way allows tables to be
                            linked together (related to each other!)

                        <h3 class="centered-text">MySQL Assignment</h3>
                        <p class="about-me">This assignment worked with a database containing information about bus drivers
                        and their schedules. Some drivers had been allocated shifts that overlapped with each other and our task was
                        to find these and print a specific message stating the overlap times and other relevant information such 
                        as the license number (LNUM) and the schedule number(SNUM). I used a self join to retreive this information, naming the two 
                        identical tables S1 and S2. I created the join on matching license number (LNUM), allowing me to find where specific routes overlapped
                        for each individual driver.
                        The line S1.SNUM < S2.SNUM meant that SQL returned each overlap only once, rather than once for each table 
                        (both S1 and S2) which was an initial problem I had. Concatenation was used to combine the required table information with the desired message and this information was stored in 
                        a new table, named 'Message'. The following diagram was used to visualise possible overlaps. </p>
