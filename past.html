            <!--Rock Snake-->
        <h3 class="centered-text">Python Object Oriented Programming Project - Rock Snake!</h3>
        <h5 class="centered-text">September 2022</h5>
        <p class="about-me">As part of my final assessment for Python, 
            I coded the snake game using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 
            This involved planning the game and working out the algorithm in detail before
            finally implementing the code. Drawio was used to create the diagrams for the 
            initial planning stage. </p>

            <h3 class="centered-text">Using Object Oriented Programming </h3>    
    
                <p class="about-me">In OOP, classes of objects are identified, 
                given properties (attributes) and methods (functions). These are then called 
                during the main game loop. My classes included Snake, Food, Sounds and Messages.</p>

                 
                <h5 class="centered-text">The 'secret' to the continuously moving snake!</h5>
                 
                <p class="about-me">The x and y variables are first used to draw the 'snake' to the screen. 
                    x_change moves the snake 20px in the direction specified by the user. Pygame KEYDOWN is used
                    to detect keyboard input. x += x_change means that the value of x (coordinates of the current position)
                    is added to or subtracted from the value of x_change (+ or - 20px) each time the main loop runs (5 times per second). The same is specified for the y axis, allowing the snake 
                    to move continously. </p>

                <img src="snake-move.png" alt="python code showing how the snake moves" class="centered-pic">
                 
                <h5 class="centered-text">Extra work</h5>

                <p class="about-me">Once I had solved some initial problems getting the snake to move using OOP, 
                    I had a lot of fun and decided to add a few extra features to make it look cool! &#128526 
                
                <h5 class="centered-text">Color Change</h5>

                <p class="about-me">The current snake length is divided in two to find the halfway point.
                    When this point reaches 50px from the border, the snake should turn red to show he is 
                    in danger!</p>
                
                <h5 class="centered-text">Snake Speed</h5>

                <p class="about-me">Pygame KEYDOWN is used to allow the user to increase or decrease the snake speed.
                This is done by increasing/decreasing the number of times the main loop runs per second
                each time the specified keys are pressed.</p>

    <h3 class="centered-text">Coding a simple chat app using Fernet encryption</h3>
    <h5 class="centered-text">September 2022</h5>
    <p class="about-me">One of my final Python projects involved creating a simple chat app, using 
        Fernet to encrypt messages as they travel accross the network. This involved creating a client
        and a server, binding the server to a socket to allow it to listen for incoming connections
        and then creating a simple WHILE loop to allow communication to continue until someone typed 'quit'.

            <h3 class="centered-text">More about Fernet </h3>    
            <p class="about-me">Fernet is part of Python's cryptography library and provides symmetric encryption,
                meaning that the same cryptographic key is used for both encryption and decryption.
                Fernet produces a token based on the plaintext message entered, a timestamp and the key.
                The ciphertext will always be a multiple of the 128-bit block size. If the message entered is not 128 bits,
                fernet will use padding to fill up any space that has not been used.

    <p class="about-me">I began studying Python in mid July, starting with the absolute
        basics and progressing to writing small snippets of code to create patterns, determine
        the age of a user based on input, operate a simple shopping checkout and other similar projects. 
        My mid term assessment was submitted five weeks into the course and can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/clynch11/Python-Beginner-Coding/blob/main/Clare%20Lynch_7568473_Assessment%203.ipynb">GitHub.</a>

            <p class="about-me">To complete the requirements of my course, 
                I have installed, uninstalled and used an Ubuntu virtual machine on both Windows11 and Mac using 
                Virtual Box. One machine was used for all mySQL assignments, whilst the other was used as 
                a vulnerable lab for SQLI practice.

            mySQL. The first project involoved designing a relational database while the second half of the subject
            focused on mySQL. MySQL Workbench and the command line on my Ubuntu VM were used to create, edit and delete sample databases.
            I also learned how to set and edit user privileges for sample databases.</p>

    <h5 class="centered-text">March 2022 </h5>
    <p class="about-me">Once enrolled in my Graduate Certificate, I prepared by trying to get a 
    basic understanding of IT. I had no technical computing knowledge other than using software I had 
    needed for my music programs prior to my career change. Whilst working my last term as a full-time
    music teacher, I began by taking a beginner's course on TryHackMe in the evenings and trying some 
    basic code lessons on the app Mimo.</p>

            I started out making basic videos on iMovie but soon became curious to learn how more engaging animated videos were made. 
            I used Da Vinci Resolve to make the following lessons and performances.

            <p class="about-me">As I made more videos, I began organising them into short courses in violin playing. 
                I hosted these courses using Teachable, desiging both the course content using tools such as Canva
                 and the sales pages.

                <p class="about-me">I also began an instagram page to promote the new part of my business and did extensive research into 
                social media marketing. 
                The instagram page can be viewed @steps2music.</p>

                <p class="about-me"> As I was increasingly enjoying the technical side of this project and
                looking towards a career change, this project became a hobby that I now work on when I have free time.</p>
