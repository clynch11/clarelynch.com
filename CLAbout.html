        <h3 class="centered-text"> Musical Training</h3>
        <ul class="about-me">
            <li>Regular attendee at Australian Youth Orchestra camps as a teenager</li>
            <br>
            <li> Accepted into the Prelude Program, allowing study at university level whilst completing year 12</li>
            <br>
            <li>Awarded a full scholarship at the University of Tasmania  </li>
            <br>
            <li>Placed on the Dean's Role of Excellence for all three full-time years at university</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <p class="about-me">After completing university, I spent time travelling and living in the UK, exploring the Irish and Shetland fiddle traditions
            and playing for enjoyment. On returning to Australia, I focussed on building my teaching studio in Melbourne 
            and encouraging students of all ages and abilities to develop sound violin technique and a love of music.

        <br>
        <h3 class="centered-text">Move to IT</h3>
        <p class="about-me">Finding myself with extra time during the pandemic, I began filming video lessons to help my students
            practice more effectively at home. I started out filming simple lessons and making small edits using iMovie,
            but quickly realised I needed more skills to produce the content that I had in mind. I finally found
            Da Vinci Resolve, which allowed me to produce more informative and engaging videos (I still can't believe this
            awesome software is totally free!). 
            <br>
            <br>
            Over time, this project turned into a short course in violin playing which I uploaded to teachable. The more
            skills I developed, the more curious I became to find out how technology worked and how I could produce higher quality content. 
            Whilst studying my Graduate Certificate in Cyber Security, I enjoyed understanding the programming languages driving websites and applications
            that we interact with everyday. After completing this course, I began studying for my CompTIA A+ certification
            which began filling in further gaps in my knowledge regarding how computers work at a hardware level and interact with the programming languages 
            I had been studying.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="about-me">In my spare time I enjoy performing and experimenting with pedals and sound-design software on my electric violin, 
            taking and editing nature photos (including the headers on this page), spending time with family and friends and keeping fit.</p>
