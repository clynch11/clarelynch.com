        <h5 class="centered-text">Started mid November 2022 </h5>
        <p class="about-me">Hoping to put some of the skills I developed at university to practical use,
            I coded this static website in Visual Studio using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I chose
            Amazon Web Services to host the page due to it's combination of simplicity and security.
            The files were then added using GitBash (and can be viewed on GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/clynch11/clarelynch.com"> here!</a>
            From here, I used a CodePipeline to send updates to the S3 bucket where the website files
            are stored. Finally, the S3 bucket is connected to CloudFront and my custom domain name set up using 
            Route53. An SSL(Secure Socket Layer) certificate allows the page to run over HTTPS, meaning the data 
            is encrypted as it travels between client and server. </p>

            which I hope will help me in my first IT-based role. I began by enrolling in
            Mike Meyers Total:CompTIA A+ Certificaton course on Udemy.

                    This page is also hosted using AWS. My next challenge will be to connect to Amazon's noSQL database Dynamo DB
                    to store student progress data.
