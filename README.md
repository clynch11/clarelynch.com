Hello! I'm Clare and I have just completed a Graduate Certificate in Cyber Security as part of a career chanage into IT. This is my first project post-uni - coding a portfolio website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have hosted this on AWS using S3, Route 53 and secured via CloudFront. The live website can be viewed at clarelynch.com and the code is available in this folder! 

Check out my progress as I begin my career!
